/**
 * To support testing of the EdenFS client library, we need to be able to
 * mock the EdenFS Thrift APIs. This is done by defining a mock service,
 * using `mockall::mock!`, that implements the EdenFS Thrift APIs.
 *
 * The mock definitions will require updates whenever the EdenFS Thrift API
 * changes. Not all changes will require an update, only those that either:
 *   1. Add/Rename a new method to the interface
 *   2. Change the parameters or return type of a method
 *   3. Introduce a breaking Thrift API changes (e.g. rename a method)
 *
 * For reference, the EdenFS client library mocks are defined here:
 *   https://www.internalfb.com/code/fbsource/fbcode/eden/fs/cli_rs/edenfs-client/src/client/mock_service.rs
